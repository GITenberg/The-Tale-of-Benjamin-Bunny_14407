description: "The Tale of Benjamin Bunny is a children's book written and illustrated\
  \ by Beatrix Potter, and first published by Frederick Warne & Co. in September 1904.\
  \ The book is a sequel to The Tale of Peter Rabbit (1902), and tells of Peter's\
  \ return to Mr. McGregor's garden with his cousin Benjamin to retrieve the clothes\
  \ he lost there during his previous adventure. In Benjamin Bunny, Potter deepened\
  \ the rabbit universe she created in Peter Rabbit, and, in doing so, suggested the\
  \ rabbit world was parallel to the human world but complete and sufficient unto\
  \ itself.\nBenjamin Bunny was an instant commercial and popular success, and thousands\
  \ of copies were in print by the end of 1904. The Times Literary Supplement thought\
  \ Potter's illustrations \"pencil perfect\", but suggested that she engage a literary\
  \ assistant for future productions. Potter created a nursery wallpaper tapping Benjamin's\
  \ image, and Benjamin returned as an adult rabbit in the Flopsy Bunnies and Mr.\
  \ Tod. In 1992, Benjamin Bunny was adapted as an episode of the BBC animated television\
  \ series, The World of Peter Rabbit and Friends.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
